# SkillShareX-
SkillShareX is a community-driven platform where people can exchange skills without money. Instead of paying for courses, you can teach what you know and learn what you want from others.
Hereâ€™s a ready-to-use README.md for your SkillShareX GitHub repository.
Itâ€™s short, simple, and hackathon-friendly, but still looks professional.
